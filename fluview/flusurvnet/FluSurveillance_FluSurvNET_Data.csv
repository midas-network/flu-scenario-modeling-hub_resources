The FluSurv-NET catchment area includes more than 90 selected counties or county equivalents in
"California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York,"
"North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah. Additional counties in Idaho (2010 to 2011),"
"Iowa (2012 to 2013, 2020 to 2022), Oklahoma (2010 to 2011), and Rhode Island (2010 to 2013) have"
"also contributed to the network. Incidence rates (per 100,000 population) are calculated using"
either the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) vintage bridged-race postcensal population
estimates (for years prior to 2020) or U.S. Census vintage unbridged-race postcensal population
estimates (for 2020 through present) for the counties or county equivalents included in the
surveillance catchment area. The rates provided are likely to be underestimated as
influenza-associated hospitalizations might be missed due to test availability and provider or
"facility testing practices. In all influenza seasons except 2009-10 and 2021-22, rates reflect"
cases hospitalized during October 1 - April 30 of each influenza season. Cases hospitalized during
"Week 39 are included in the totals for Week 40, while cases hospitalized during Week 18 are"
"included in the totals for Week 17. In 2009-10, rates reflect cases hospitalized during Sept 1 2009"
through April 30 2010 (Week 35 - Week 17) but the graph displayed starts Oct 1 2009 (Week 40) so
weekly and cumulative rates from Sept 1 2009 through Sept 30 2009 (Week 35 – Week 39) are not
"displayed even though these rates contribute to the cumulative total. In 2021-22, rates reflect"
"cases hospitalized beginning October 1 2021 (Week 39), but given late influenza season activity,"
"the season was extended to June 11, 2022 (Week 23). In 2023-2024, surveillance was extended to"
"September 28, 2024 (Week 39) for situational awareness during the ongoing outbreak of highly"
"pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus among birds, poultry, dairy cattle, and other"
animals in the United States (H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary | Avian Influenza (Flu)
