#### Round 4 Resources

* `Age_Specific_Coverage_Flu_RD2_2022_23_Sc_A_B_C_D.csv` simulates influenza vaccine coverage in fall-winter 2023-2024 to be used for round 4. The data in this file provides weekly cumulative coverages by state and adult and child age groups. Estimates are based on the reported coverage of the flu vaccine in the 2021-2022 fall season by month, state, and age. We used a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial to generate weekly coverage estimates from monthly data. Dates have been shifted to reflect projection weeks in the 2023-2024 season. The data in this file can be used as is (no adjustment to coverage should be needed). Age groups can be collapsed based on provided pop sizes.
