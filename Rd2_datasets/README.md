#### Round 2 Resources

* `Age_Specific_Coverage_Flu_RD2_2022_23_Sc_A_B_C_D.csv` simulates influenza vaccine coverage in fall-winter 2022-2023 to be used for round 2. The data in this file provides weekly cumulative coverages by state and adult and child age groups. The same coverage should be applied to all scenarios. Estimates are based on the reported coverage of the flu vaccine in the 2021-2022 fall season by month, state, and age. We used a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial to generate weekly coverage estimates from monthly data. Dates have been shifted to reflect projection weeks in the 2022-2023 season. The data in this file can be used as is (no adjustment to coverage should be needed). Age groups can be collapsed based on provided pop sizes.

* `In-season-National-Deaths.csv` shows national weekly real-time estimates of influenza burden provided by the CDC during the 2022-2023 season, as of 11/14/2022. The data in this file provides high and low bounds for weekly cumulative national deaths; this encompasses deaths occurring in the hospital, at home and in nursing homes, and adjust for under-reporting. These are the same estimates that are provided in the CDC burden pyramid at the end of the season.
